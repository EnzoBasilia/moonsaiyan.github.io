				<h2>Expectations?</h2>
				<h3>In subject..</h3>
				<p>I would like to have fun while learning new ways to set up a website. I hope my relationship with the subject can be like a serious committed relationship where give and take is the thing. </p>
				<h3>For the teacher..</h3>
				<p>I hope the teacher will <u>always</u> be <b>energized</b>, <b>patient</b> and <b>cheerful</b> in teaching the subject. I don't want to make my course a reason for my incapability to be in the same level of ComSci peep's knowledge, but I hope I won't become a headache for the upcoming discussions.</p>
